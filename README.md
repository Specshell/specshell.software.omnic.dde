# Omnic DDE commands #

This repository contains Omnic specific DDE commands that attempt to be strongly typed.\
An implementation of the omnic DDE client is not part of this repository.

Thermo Fisher has supplied an [article](./docs/OMNIC_DDE_Commands_&_Parameters.pdf) for DDE commands supported by Omnic, however it has been found that Omnic supports the `[advanced ATR]` DDE call, which is not documented in the article.

This hints that Omnic might support other DDE commands not mentioned in the article.
